# IntelliTab: AI-Powered Browser Organization

**Stop losing focus in a sea of tabs. Let AI do the cleaning for you.**

IntelliTab is a next-generation tab manager that uses advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently categorize, group, and declutter your browser window in real-time. Whether you're a developer with 50 documentation tabs or a student juggling multiple research projects, IntelliTab restores order with a single click.

### 🧠 Key Features

- **Inteligent Auto-Grouping**: Powered by the Groq Llama 3.3 70B model, IntelliTab analyzes the content and context of your open tabs to create logical, beautifully named groups (e.g., "Dev - Frontend", "Study - CS511", "Communication").
- **Deterministic Rules Engine**: Set "Always Group" or "Protect" rules for specific domains. Ensure Gmail always goes to "Communication" or GitHub always lands in "Dev" without the AI having to guess.
- **Adaptive Learning Engine**: The more you use it, the smarter it gets. IntelliTab tracks your manual grouping habits and builds a local profile of your preferences.
- **AI Feedback Chat**: Not happy with a grouping decision? Talk to the AI. Use the built-in feedback loop to explain your preferences and "retrain" the system's behavior in real-time.
- **Privacy-First Design**: Your tab data is processed securely via your own Groq API key. Your grouping habits, "SOUL" instructions, and history are stored locally in your browser—never on our servers.
- **Modern Grayscale Aesthetic**: A premium, minimal UI featuring glassmorphism and automatic light/dark mode support that feels like a native part of your OS.

### 🚀 Why IntelliTab?

Standard tab managers require constant manual effort. IntelliTab is designed to be a "Librarian" that understands your intent. By providing the AI with a "SOUL" (a set of core behavioral truths), you can define exactly how your digital workspace should look, and watch as it maintains that standard for you.
